### Hi there, I'm Lahun Kiryl 👋

## I'm a Data Analyst📝 with Medical background👨‍⚕️!
After 6 years in health care, I began to notice more and more often that working with patient data, deriving patterns and testing hypotheses are the most interesting part of my profession. Consequently, I decided that it was worth improving my knowledge in data analysis, and while studying at Yandex Practicum I was even more convinced that I wanted to connect my further career with work in data analysis.

### Skills 💻
* SQL knowledge and hands-on experience (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)
* Pre-processing and exploratory data analysis using Python
* Using python libraries `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplolib`, `seaborn`, `plotly express`, `folium`
* Unit economics with calculation of LTV, CAC and ROI indicators in Python
